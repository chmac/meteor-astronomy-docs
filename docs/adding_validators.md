{{#template name="AddingValidators"}}
There are two ways of adding validators to the class. You can define them on the level of the class or on the level of the field definition. Let's take a look at the example of both.

**Validators on the class level**

Validators of the class level have to be defined under the `validators` property in the class schema.

```js
User = Astro.Class({
  name: 'User',
  /* ... */
  validators: {
    firstName: Validators.minLength(3)
  }
});
```

As you can see, we've added the `minLength` validator for the `firstName` field. We will write more about available validators and their options.

**Validators on the field level**

You can also define validators with a field definition, to keep them together and make it more readable. To do that you have to define validator under the `validator` property.

```js
User = Astro.Class({
  name: 'User',
  /* ... */
  fields: {
    firstName: {
      type: 'string',
      validator: Validators.minLength(3)
    }
  }
});
```

*NOTICE: In a field definition the correct property name is `validator` (singular) and in the class definition it `validators` (plural).*

**Passing array of validators**

As a value of the `validators` or `validator` property you can pass array of validators. In such situation array of validators will be replaced with the `and` validator. The `and` validator means that all sub-validators has to pass validation test to mark field's value as valid. The two following examples are equivalent.

The `and` validator:

```js
User = Astro.Class({
  name: 'User',
  /* */
  validators: {
    firstName: Validators.and([
      Validators.required(),
      Validators.string()
    ])
  }
});
```

Array of validators:

```js
User = Astro.Class({
  name: 'User',
  /* */
  validators: {
    firstName: [
      Validators.required(),
      Validators.string()
    ]
  }
});
```

**Reusing validators**

Sometimes you may notice that you repeat the same set of validators over and over again. There is a possibility to reuse validators.

```js
var reqStrMin3 = Validators.and([
  Validators.required(),
  Validators.string(),
  Validators.minLength(3)
]);

User = Astro.Class({
  name: 'User',
  /* */
  validators: {
    firstName: reqStrMin3,
    lastName: reqStrMin3
  }
});
```

**Types of validator params**

Most of the validators take a param as the first argument. The param may differ from validator to validator. Let's examine some cases.

Array of validators. They `and` and `or` validators are the only two predefined validators that take an array of validators as a param. We will write more about them in next sections.

```js
Validators.and([
  Validators.string(),
  Validators.minLength(3)
]);

Validators.or([
  Validators.string(),
  Validators.minLength(3)
]);
```

There are validators that take a single plain value (string, number) as a param. The examples of them are: `minLength`, `equal`, `contains`. We will write more about them in next sections.

```js
Validators.minLength(3);
Validators.equal('mustBeEqualToThisString');
Validators.contains('mustContainThisString');
```

There are validators that take array of some values or object with some validator details. The examples of them are: `choice`, `if`. We will write more about them in next sections.

```js
Validators.choice(['value', 'has', 'to', 'match', 'one', 'of', 'these']);
Validators.if({
  condition: function() {
    return this.lastName > 5;
  },
  true: Validators.maxLength(10),
  false: Validators.minLength(2)
});
```

There are also validators that does not take any param. The example of them are: `string`, `number`, `boolean`.

**Function as a validator param**

There is a special type of a param. If a validator takes parameter, you can also pass a function as a param. In such situation, the param value will be calculated on validation execution. It's very useful when we want to depend validation of one field on the value of another field.

```js
validators: {
  firstName: Validators.string(),
  lastName: Validators.minLength(function() {
    // A value of the "lastName" field has to be at least as long as a value of
    // the "firstName" field.
    return this.firstName.length;
  });
}
```

*NOTICE: It's important to remember that a function param works with every validator that takes param as the first argument.*
